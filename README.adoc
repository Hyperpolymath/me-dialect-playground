== What is Me?

Me is a programming language designed specifically for young learners (ages 8-12).
It uses a familiar HTML-like syntax that feels like building a webpage, making
programming approachable and fun!

== Why Me?

=== Designed for Young Minds

* **Familiar syntax**: Looks like the HTML kids see on websites
* **Visual feedback**: See your code come to life instantly
* **Safe sandbox**: Can't break anything - experiment freely!
* **Progressive learning**: Start simple, discover more as you grow

=== Not Like Other Languages

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Other Languages | Me Language | Why It Matters

| `print("Hello")`
| `<say>Hello!</say>`
| Feels like writing a note

| `x = 5`
| `<remember name="score">5</remember>`
| Describes what it does

| `if x > 10:`
| `<when score-is="big">...</when>`
| Plain English conditions

| `for i in range(5):`
| `<repeat times="5">...</repeat>`
| Says exactly what happens
