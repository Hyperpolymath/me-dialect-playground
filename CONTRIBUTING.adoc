== Guidelines for Child-Friendly Development

When contributing to Me, please keep in mind our target audience (ages 8-12):

=== Language Design

* Use simple, plain English
* Avoid jargon and technical terms
* Make error messages friendly and helpful
* Never make kids feel bad for making mistakes

=== Error Messages

**Bad:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token at line 5`

**Good:** `Oops! Something doesn't look quite right on line 5. Did you forget to close a tag?`

=== Examples

* Use relatable scenarios (games, pets, stories)
* Keep examples short and focused
* Include lots of comments explaining what's happening
* Test with actual children when possible

=== Safety First

* Never add network functionality
* Never add file system access
* Always sandbox code execution
* Never collect any user data

== Commit Guidelines

* Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
* Sign all commits (DCO required)
* Atomic, focused commits

== Code Style

* ReScript for application logic (per RSR Language Policy)
* Deno for runtime (not Node/npm/bun per RSR)
* Descriptive variable names
* Extensive comments for educational clarity

== Testing

[source,bash]
----
# Run all tests
just test

# Run specific level examples
just example-level1
just example-level2
just example-level3

# Run game example
just example-game
----
